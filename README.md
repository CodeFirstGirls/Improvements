# Improvements
CF:G wish list of improvements. If you'd like to help us fix/improve our syllabus and materials, feel free to pick something from the list below :) 
Some points are just for general discussion rather than projects, but we'll really appreciate your views!

If you see anything you'd like to help with, let us know at programmes@codefirstgirls.org.uk.

No amount of help is too small! If you can't commit to too many edits, you can jump on a collaborative project (we're happy to set up some once we know who would like to contribute)


*H - Intro to Web Development course*

*P - Python for Web Development course*

H. Week 5. Update Bootstrap version in Week 5 slides. Remove bootstrap code from the project (it's supposed to be added by the students and shouldn't be in the original code at all)

H. Ideas for making GitHub class simpler

H. Pick the best tool to potentially replace Atom (preferably something which would work less with GitHub to make it less confusing for students). 

H. Suggest a different order of topics covered in the Beginners course

H. Make UX class shorter to accommodate more technical material. If UX class is shorter, how do we make it informative? Ideas welcome!



P. Update all slides to Python 3.X syntax

P. Pick the best Python editor (Github, Mac, Windows, and ideally Chromebook friendly. Oh, and free to use.)

P. Update old Windows setup discussions (hey seem to be out of date)

P. Learn Python The Hard Way links should be replaced with similar relevant exercises from open/free websites

P. Discuss any other potential updates


**Thank you! We love you all!**
